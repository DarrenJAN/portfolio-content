		<h1>Post Malone</h1>
		<h2>1995/06/04 - unknown</h2>
		<p>
			"As an artist, it's never really enough.
			You always want to strive to get bigger 
			and better and push the limits of what you can actually do." â€” Post Malone
		</p>
		<p>
			Post Malon's orginal name is Austin Richard Post, known professionally as
			an American rapper, singer, songwriter and record producer. His compositions 
			blend different pop genres, including pop, trap and rock styles, and his 
			introspective songwriting and clean vocals make Malone popular.
		</p>
		<p>
			Malone was born in Syracuse, New York, and grew up in Grapevine, Texas.
			He chose "Post Malone" as his stage name when he was 14 or 15 years old. 
			There were rumors that the name was a reference to professional basketball player Karl Malone, 
			but Malone later explained that "Post" was his last name and that "Malone" was 
			generated by him using a "rap name generator". At 16, Malone created his first mixtape, 
			"Young and After Them Riches," using the audio editing software Audacity, and 
			showed it to some of his high school classmates. In high school, he was described 
			by his classmates as "most likely to become famous". He worked at the fast-food restaurant 
			Chicken Express as a teenager. Malone later attended Tarrant County College, 
			but eventually dropped out. After leaving college, Malone and his longtime 
			friend Jason Probst moved to Los Angeles, California.
